*by Jan T. Sott*

Highlights NSIS commands in Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. The following websites are supported:

* Winamp.com forums
* NSIS Sourceforge pages
* Stack Overflow

## Installation

### Firefox

1. Make sure you already have the [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) add-on installed
2. Download `NSIS-Linker.user.js`
3. Drag the downloaded file to your Firefox window or open the Add-ons window (`Ctrl+Shift+A` on Windows and Linux, `⇧⌘A` on OS X) and add the file

GreaseMonkey will automatically perform an upgrade once a new version is available!

### Chrome

1. Download `NSIS-Linker.user.js`
2. Open the extensions window from the tool menu
3. Drag the downloaded file to the extensions window

Unfortunately, the script isn't as reliable as in Firefox. If no links are created at all, please try reloading the page.

### Opera

1. Open the Preferences, go to Advanced > Content > JavaScript Options and specify a User JavaScript folder
2. Download `NSIS-Linker.user.js` to that folder

If you run into troubles, you can also try this [alternative method](http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/operaStuff/userJavaScript.html#compatibility). As future versions of Opera will be using Google's Blink engine, compatibility with this user script will like improve.
